# refocus-bdk
This is the repository for the refocus-bdk. The bdk (bot development kit) contains a set of utilities used by Refocus Bots to communicate with [Refocus Rooms](https://github.com/salesforce/refocus).

## Getting Started
These instructions will enable you to have a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Env Variables
Note: If you want to test this locally you will need some environment variables:
* ```USE_POLLING``` - If you want polling set this to true, else default to sockets
* ```BOT_LOGGING``` - If you want to enable logging to a log file set this to "file", if you want to set logging to a console log then set this to "console", if you want to have both set this to "both", if you want neither logging set this to "none", defaults to "console"
* ```CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL``` - Set the level of console out you want to see, defaults to 'info'. All levels include error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly see [WinstonJS](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/tree/2.4.0) for more details
* ```FILE_LOG_LEVEL``` - Set the level of logging you want in your log file, defaults to 'verbose'. All levels include error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly see [WinstonJS](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/tree/2.4.0) for more details
* ```HEARTBEAT_OFF``` - Turns off bot heartbeat to refocus
* ```HEARTBEAT_TIMER``` - how often in milliseconds the heartbeat is sent with a minimum of 1 minute


### Coding Example
```javascript
const bdk = require('@salesforce/refocus-bdk')(config);
bdk.createBotData(roomId, botName, 'timers', JSON.stringify(timers))
```
